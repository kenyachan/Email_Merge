# Developer Tools

The purpose of the *DevTools* module is to provide functions that will aid in the development of a VBA project. Such functions as exporting all Modules, Class Modules, and UserForms so that they can then be checked into source control.

The *DevTools* module can be imported into any VBA project and used.

In order for the *DevTools* module to work, you will need to *Trust access to the VBA project Object model* via the *Trust Center Settings*, and include *Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3* in the references.

In the Excel Trust Center Settings, select *Trust access to the VBA project object model*.
